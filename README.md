# MazeSolver-BFS
A Python implementation of the **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** algorithm to find the shortest path in a maze.  
The program visualizes visited nodes and the final path in the console using colored output.

## Features
- BFS algorithm for shortest path search
- Tracks execution time and memory usage
- Shows visited cells (red) and solution path (green)
- Supports 10 predefined test cases with different goal positions
